# Qubic Core Services Budget Proposal

**Proposal for approval**: Qubic Core Services budget proposal for the next 3 months.  
We’re changing our name from **Steering Committee (SteCo)** to **Qubic Core Services (QCS)** as it better reflects the services we want to provide to Qubic and the community.

## Finance through CCF Donations

QCS is requesting funding from the **Computor Control Fund (CCF)** to fund running costs like overhead and to fund larger impact initiatives from Marketing and Ecosystem. The budget overview includes a breakdown of the different workgroups and their budgeted expenditure.

---

## Details about Workgroups

All QCS workgroups work closely together to achieve the following two objectives:

- Develop a vibrant ecosystem for all our stakeholders (token holders, miners, partners, and institutions).
- Advance AI research and core development.
- Ensure Qubic’s ecosystem financial health and long-term success.

### Marketing (8 HC)

The Marketing team focuses on increasing the brand awareness and visibility of Qubic. It does this through social marketing, content marketing, growth marketing, and PR. To accelerate our impact, we’ve partnered with **Serotonin**, who consults Qubic on brand messaging, earned, paid, and owned media. This budget proposal includes two options to further boost Qubic’s marketing activity:

- **Booster 1 - Tier 1 PR**: 40k p.month on top of base  -> This will allows us to advertise Qubic on renowned platforms like Coindesk , Coindesk Newsletters, Cointelegraph etc.
- **Booster 1 + 2 - Tier 1 PR + KOLs**: 80k p.month on top of base -> PR from Booster 1 with paid KOLs that are approved and management by some of our current organic KOLs that will Work only with legit and reputable KOLs.

**Note**: Important to know is that this is still not full throttle marketing compared to other projects and for the things we want to achieve. But while looking at the current CCF these are reasonable numbers that will still get us an awesome boost short term. 


### Ecosystem Development (5 HC)

The Ecosystem Development team focuses on expanding the Qubic ecosystem through the development of grants programs, incubator program, crypto partnerships and institutional real-world partnerships. In Q3 and Q4, the Ecosystem team has onboarded close to 10 different projects onto the Qubic ecosystem, among them Vottun and Qubex that are creating wider user adoption. The team is also responsible for maintaining relationships with exchanges, listings, market makers and universities. The budget requested is to fund running costs, to onboard a new market maker and to organize smaller events. Additionally, the team will work to pave the way for the ecosystem to operate independently in a decentralized manner as quickly as possible.


### Community Management (15 HC)

TThe Community Management team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channel. It also relies on volunteers. Together with volunteers they are a total team of 22. The team ensures that both existing and new community members are welcomed, encourages conversations and makes sure community guidelines are followed.Furthermore there are engagement campaigns running on discord and telegram, like quizzes, game night, etc, with small prizes to win. The budget requested is to fund running costs and to fund these smaller mini games to keep community members engaged.

### Strategy, Operations, Finance (SOF) (3 HC)

The SFO team focuses on supporting the other workgroups and the ecosystem with strategy, operations and finance initiatives. It drives the roadmap, objective key-results, helps accelerate key- projects, budgeting, HR, legal advisory and helps to operationally onboard new projects into the Qubic ecosystem by for example providing guidance to write CCF or grant proposals. The budget requested is to fund running costs, to expand the team with 1HC to help support the growing ecosystem, to incorporate a Swiss association and to onboard an external controller/accountant that will help report expenses across QCS and/or Core Technology.

## Budget Proposal

**Table 1**  







From Table 1, we are requesting **552 bnQu** for base operations over 3 months, likely split into 3 monthly requests. Optional marketing boosters could increase the request to **663 bnQu** and **712 bnQu** respectively. This budget is below the CCF income rate, leaving funds available for other initiatives. The payout schedule depends on other proposals. See Table 2 for CCF balance projections including Core Tech budget assumption.

## FAQ

**Q. Why do you need so much funding now?**  
A. We need increased marketing power for ads on X and Telegram, paid sponsorships, and KOL onboarding to capitalize on the bull run. We are also expanding marketing into the United States, raising budget needs.

**Q. How will you measure the impact of marketing and what if it doesn’t work?**  
A. We hold weekly calls with **Serotonin** to track channel growth and funnel conversions across owned, earned, and paid media. We discuss opportunities and blockers. All QCS members and some community OGs attend. We aim to increase Qubic’s followers on X, Discord, and Telegram by 25%, achieve a 2-8% CTR from Spindl Ads, secure 5 paid sponsorships, 5 media hits, 3 bylines, and 2 podcasts per quarter. If this approach doesn’t yield results by February, we will pivot, explore new agencies, or let the community take control.

**Q. How do you keep the community informed about progress?**  
A. We provide weekly QCS updates, monthly marketing progression updates, and a monthly spending report.

**Q. Why is there no budget for listing?**  
A. We prioritized running costs and marketing. Listing costs vary, and we prefer to request a separate budget when closing a listing. Funds are available as shown below.

**Q. Do we have enough funds to meet this budget request?**  
A. Yes, Table 2 shows projected CCF balances, including both boosters. Our request is below the CCF income, leaving the current balance unaffected. We also accounted for Core Tech and Ledger proposal expenses. The end balance for January is projected at **373 bnQu**, approximately USD 560k at the current rate, enough for new projects or listings.

**Q. Are these funds sufficient for the Market Makers (MMs)?**  
A. Yes, the funds are adequate. We’ve secured a partnership with a new MM, to be announced soon. We will receive **246 bnQu** back from the previous MM, which will be transferred to the new MM.

**Q. Who is part of Qubic Core Services?**  
A. The teams include:
