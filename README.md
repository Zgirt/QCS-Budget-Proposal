- **Booster 1 + 2** - Tier 1 PR + KOLs: $80k per month (in addition to base) to add paid, reputable KOLs.

### Ecosystem Development (5 HC)
This team is responsible for expanding Qubic's ecosystem through grants, partnerships, and institutional alliances. It also manages relationships with exchanges, listings, market makers, and universities. Funding covers running costs, onboarding a new market maker, and organizing smaller events.

### Community Management (15 HC)
The Community team moderates Qubic's Discord and Telegram channels, supported by volunteers for a total team size of 22. They welcome new members, encourage engagement, and ensure community guidelines are followed. Funds are requested to support running costs and engagement campaigns like quizzes and game nights.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  **WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE FAQ's AS WE PROCEED**

**Q: Why is additional funding needed now?**  
A: We need more marketing power to capitalize on the bull run through ads on X and Telegram, paid sponsorships, and KOLs. Additionally, our U.S. market expansion requires a larger budget.

**Q: How will you ensure marketing efforts have impact?**  
A: We hold weekly calls with Serotonin to track growth in followers and funnel conversions. Our goals include:
   - 25% increase in Qubic’s X, Discord, and Telegram followers.
   - 2-8% CTR from Spindl Ads to the Qubic site.
   - At least 5 paid sponsorships, 5 media hits, 3 bylines, and 2 podcasts per quarter.

**Q: How will the community be informed of progress?**  
A: Weekly SteCo updates, monthly marketing progress reports, and monthly spending reports are shared with the community.

**Q: Why is there no budget for listing?**  
A: At this point, covering running costs and marketing are our priorities. Listing costs can vary, and we'll request a budget specifically for listings when closing a deal.

**Q: Are there sufficient funds to cover the budget request?**  
A: Yes. The projected balance (see Table 2) shows that this proposal is within the current CCF income rate, ensuring sufficient reserves for new projects.

**Q: Are the funds adequate for Market Makers (MMs)?**  
A: Yes, we've secured a partnership with a new MM. The funds requested, along with the return of 246 bnQu from the previous MM, should meet current needs.
