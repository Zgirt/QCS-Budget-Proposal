# Qubic Core Services Budget Proposal

## Proposal for approval: Qubic Core Services budget proposal for the next 3 months

We’re changing our name from **Steering Committee (SteCo)** to **Qubic Core Services (QCS)** as it better reflects the services we want to provide to Qubic and the community.

### Finance through CCF donations

QCS is requesting funding from the **Computor Control Fund (CCF)** to fund running costs like overhead and to fund larger impact initiatives from Marketing and Ecosystem. The budget overview includes a breakdown of the different workgroups and their budgeted expenditure.

---

## Details about Workgroups

All QCS workgroups work closely together to achieve the following two objectives:

1. Develop a vibrant ecosystem for all our stakeholders (token holders, miners, partners, and institutions)
2. Advance AI research and core development
3. Ensure Qubic’s ecosystem financial health and long-term success

### Marketing (8 HC)

The Marketing team focuses on increasing the brand awareness and visibility of Qubic. It does this through social marketing, content marketing, growth marketing, and PR. To accelerate our impact, we’ve partnered with **Serotonin**, who consults Qubic on brand messaging, earned, paid, and owned media. This budget proposal includes two options to boost Qubic’s marketing activity:

- **Booster 1 - Tier 1 PR**: $40k per month on top of base -> This allows us to advertise Qubic on renowned platforms like Coindesk, Coindesk Newsletters, Cointelegraph, etc.
- **Booster 1 + 2 - Tier 1 PR + KOLs**: $80k per month on top of base -> PR from Booster 1 with paid KOLs approved and managed by some of our current organic KOLs. We work only with reputable KOLs.

**Note**: This is not full-throttle marketing compared to other projects, but it is reasonable given the current CCF budget.

### Ecosystem Development (5 HC)

The Ecosystem Development team focuses on expanding the Qubic ecosystem through grants programs, incubator programs, crypto partnerships, and institutional partnerships. In Q3 and Q4, the team onboarded nearly 10 projects, including **Vottun** and **Qubex**, driving user adoption. The team also manages relationships with exchanges, listings, market makers, and universities. The requested budget covers running costs, onboarding a new market maker, and organizing smaller events.

### Community Management (15 HC)

The Community Management team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channel, including a total of 22 members with volunteers. They ensure new members are welcomed, encourage conversations, and enforce community guidelines. The requested budget covers running costs and engagement campaigns, like quizzes and game nights, to keep members engaged.

### Strategy, Operations, Finance (3 HC)

The SOF team supports other workgroups with strategy, operations, and finance initiatives. It manages the roadmap, objectives, budgeting, HR, legal advisory, and onboarding of new projects into the Qubic ecosystem. The requested budget covers running costs, team expansion, incorporation of a Swiss association, and onboarding an external controller/accountant for expense reporting.

## Budget Proposal

**Table 1**

![table 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1cad879-b563-4d1e-a136-456a96f7e5fe)

From Table 1, we are requesting **552 bnQu** for base operations over 3 months, split into 3 monthly requests. With optional marketing boosters, the request increases to **663 bnQu** and **712 bnQu**, respectively. The budget is below the CCF income rate, allowing funds for other initiatives. See **Table 2** for CCF balance projections, including Core Tech assumptions.

## FAQ

**Q. Why do you need so much funding now?**  
A. We need more marketing power for ads on X and Telegram, paid sponsorships, and onboarding of KOLs to catch the bull run. We are also expanding marketing into the United States.

**Q. How will you measure marketing impact and what if it doesn’t work?**  
A. We have weekly calls with **Serotonin** on channel growth and conversion metrics. We aim for a 25% increase in followers on X, Discord, and Telegram, and a 2-8% CTR from Spindl Ads to the Qubic site. If this doesn’t yield results by February, we will pivot to a new strategy.

**Q. How do you keep the community informed about progress?**  
A. We provide weekly QCS updates, monthly marketing updates, and a monthly spending report.

**Q. Why is there no budget for listing?**  
A. We prioritized running costs and marketing. Listing costs will be requested separately when needed.

**Q. Do we have enough funds for your budget request?**  
A. Yes, our request is below CCF income projections, leaving reserves for new projects or listings.

**Q. Are these funds sufficient for Market Makers (MMs)?**  
A. Yes, we’ve secured a new MM partnership, and funds from the previous MM will be transferred.
